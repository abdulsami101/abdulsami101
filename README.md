## 🧑‍💻 Experience

- 🧪 **Research Assistant**  
  📍 *System Software Lab, Soongsil University*  
  🗓️ *Sep 2023 – Present*  
  Working under the supervision of **Prof. Jaeyong Choi** (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PkXLB5EAAAAJ&hl=ko) on advanced research in generative models, especially diffusion-based image generation for multilingual fonts. Involved in model design, experiment tracking, dataset engineering, and paper writing.

## 🧑‍🔬 Current Research
I'm currently working on **DK-Font: Diffusion-Driven Multilingual Font Generation**, a novel method that blends phonetic awareness with iterative refinement to generate high-quality fonts across languages using diffusion models.

🔍 I'm also exploring applications in **Computer Vision**, particularly with:
- Object Detection using **YOLOv5/v8**
- Style transfer and content manipulation
- Feature extraction with **VGG**, **CLIP**, and **ResNet**
